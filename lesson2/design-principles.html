                Google's website is a good example of White space and clean design in web development.
                 When someone goes to Google's webpage, they are almost always going there for one reason only
                 - to do a search. Google realized this and instead of making the user navigate through a bunch
                 of adds the search bar is right in the middle of the page without anything around it. White
                space does not necessarily need to be white but in this case it is.

            <p>
                Pepsi website is an example of Hicks Law. Hicks Law states that the more choices you present yours users with , 
                the longer it will take them to reach a decision. pepsi only has a few options on its main website. It probably
                 has many more linked subpages to it but, a user can navigate teh main site easily.

            <p>
                Pizza hut has a lot of content and choices that a user will have to make on its website. 
                The overall navigation and use of the website is easy however becasue it uses the design element 
                of alignment.
